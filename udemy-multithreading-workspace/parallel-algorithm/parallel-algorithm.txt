parallel algoruthms:
	We try to break the bigger porblem into smaller problem and solve them individually in different process at same time
	-> not like convurrnecy where multiple threads/tasks runs on same processor using time slicing
	
issues with parallel algorithms:
a. Thread communication among different CPU cores, 
	-> if we divide the items among different cpu cores then we have to deal with task of merging them 
	which will take some time as threads intercommunication among different cpu cores are more time consuming
b. Proper logical division of worke is needed,
	eg: finding prime factors of number 0-1000 and if we split 0-500 and 501-1000 logicall it is not good
		as for finding numbers higher among the array will take more time and hence first half will be done and will be waiting
		-> this issue is solved in Fork join framework where work stealing happens
