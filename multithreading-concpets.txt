Differencet between parallen and concurrenct programming

Parallel										Concurrencyt

a. we use multiple cores of CPU i.e multiple process                                  a. it can run on even single core
b. in paralel we have indepednet taskrunning on threads                                b. sharing of data or variable is there
c. This is doing the task to enhance performance                                       c. it is solving issues that happens becuase of parallelism
d. forkjoin pool , threads , paralel stream                                             d. eg: completable future , volatile , concurrent collections , atomic semaphores, renetrnat lock



States of thread : 

New Thread -> NEW
T1.start -> RUNNABLE
t1.wait // t1.sleep -> WAITING
t1.join  -> block eecution until thread conmpletes -> DEAD


Sleep puts thread in waiting state,  Wait also put thread in waiting state

Wait												Sleep

Thread goes to waiting state until another thread notify to make                                Thread goes to waiting state untill the time mentioned in MS and then it 
the thread in runnable state                                                                     comes to runnable state


- Multi tasking means a CPU is running multiple applications in different processes
- If within the same process we are doing multitasking that would need to create and run multiple threads within the same process

- We can call thread.start() instance method only once, if for same instance of thread it is called twice it throws illegalstate exception(runtime exception)

- Creating thread run method implementation is better using runnable inteface, 
	-> it allows us to still extend another class and add functionalities, if we extend thread we can not extend another class

- Thread gets priority of its parent creator thread if not set
- 1 is for minimum priority ad 10 is for max we can not set outside of this range
- thread scheudler picks threads from thread pool of runnable state with highest pririty first 
- default priority of main thread is 5

----- yield method : static method
		   -> allows chance for current running thread to go away to runnable state if one thread is in runnable pool of smae priority
		   -> if priority of thread in waiting pool is lower thatn running thread than same current thread will continue
	use case: if we have a very long time consuming task then we can do periodic yield, and if equal or higher priority thread is in runnable state,
	 it will get kicked up and old thread will go to runnable state waiting for some time unitl thread scheduler picks him up for continuing the task

--------- interrupt method
- If we call interrupt method it actually do not interrupt , but just set interrputed flag to true
- And if we were sleeping or joining in that thread it throws Interrupptedexception and it will break the sleep or join fronm there
- basic purpose is that if we call interrupt on a thread instance, then kill it only if it is sleeping or joining on another thread
	- thats why these methods throw Interruptedexception
- if we still want to handle interruption we can use flag isinterrupted, or forcefully put try catch of interrupttedexception there

- Race condition occurs when same shared resource data is maanipulated by miltiple threads and the manipulation operation is non atomic,
	task like int x=23; is single step and is atomic and these tasks do not cause race condition even in case of multiple threads mutationg shared object

- We must know that 32 bit opreations like int a=23, short b=12 are atomic but long s=23 is not as thery are 64 bit

- synchronized locks on object level for instance method, meaning if same object is passed and differnet thread is shareing the object nad using its synchronized methods
	it locks one by one for thme, but if 2 differnet objects are passed to threads then no lock will occur and no race condition occurs

- Thread groups are a collection of similar task doing threads,
	Using this we can interrupt/sleep all the threads in one line of code
- Main method runs by main thread whihc is part of main thread group nad parent of main thread group is system whihc is the root thread group

- cause of concurrentmodificationexception:
	a. when we are iterating arraylost/collection/map and during the iteration we remove object using collection.remove method
	b. when one thread is writing to collection and at the same time another thread is reading from the collection	, during reading it occurs

- concurrent collections can be used while collections are operated among multiuple threads at the same time
	like reading/writing among multiple threads
